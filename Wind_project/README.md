This includes my contributions to a group project in which we were attempting to determine if wind farms could be improved by changing turbine heights to reduce wind effects. I was responsible for consolidating wind speed data and determining general speed and direction trends, and how speed changed with height.

Note: WindRose.m is not a file I created; I used it to help visualize wind patterns.x
